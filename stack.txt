Ideally the maintainer will only have to update "Intel OpenCL specific stack" and intel-graphics-compiler.
However, they may end up having to update other parts of the stack as well.

`intel-compute-runtime` and `intel-graphics-compiler` are normally the most troublesome packages.

Intel OpenCL specific stack
  - intel-compute-runtime
  - intel-level-zero
  - igsc
  - intel-metee

Common dependencies
  - intel-gpu-tools (mostly putting here as can be useful for testing)
  - intel-media-driver (uses gmmlib)
  - embree (uses ispc)
  - libva
  - libva-utils
  - gmmlib

Tied to LLVM rebuilds
  - intel-graphics-compiler (intel opencl specific)
  - ispc
  - vc-intrinsics
  - opencl-clang
  - spirv-llvm-translator

SPIRV stuff
  - spirv-cross
  - spirv-tools
  - spirv-headers

Vendor Neutral OpenCL stack
  - clinfo
  - libclc
  - ocl-icd
  - opencl-clhpp
  - opencl-headers
